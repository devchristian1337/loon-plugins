## 🔧 How These Plugins Work

These plugins use various advanced techniques to enhance your streaming experience:

- **URL Rewriting**: Blocks ad requests and modifies network responses
- **Script Injection**: Modifies app behavior to enable premium features
- **MitM (Man-in-the-Middle)**: Intercepts and modifies traffic securely
- **Header Manipulation**: Bypasses restrictions by modifying request headers
- **Response Modification**: Alters server responses to unlock premium content

Each plugin is specifically designed for its respective application while requiring minimal setup from you.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- If ads still appear, try clearing the app cache or reinstalling YouTube
